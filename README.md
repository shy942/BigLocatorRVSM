# BigLocatorRVSM
Go to rvsm.calculator package
open RVSMCalc.java
Run this

This is the main file where I call simi.score.calculator.SimiScoreCalc.java for computing SimiScore 
Here, I did normalization and combine both soce

For normalizing rVSMscore I retrieve hightest and lowest rVSM score and normalize them, it is done in RVSMCalc.java

For normalizing SimiScore I also did the same which is done in SimiScoreCalc.java
