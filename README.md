Go to rvsm.calculator package
open RVSMCalc.java
Run this.

Note that I am keeping data in local pc. Because they are so big.

This is the main file where I call simi.score.calculator.SimiScoreCalc.java for computing SimiScore 
Here, I did normalization and combine both soce

For normalizing rVSMscore I retrieve hightest and lowest rVSM score and normalize them, it is done in RVSMCalc.java

For normalizing SimiScore I also did the same which is done in SimiScoreCalc.java
